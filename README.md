Like its predecessor, TinyGPS, this library provides compact and easy-to-use methods for extracting position, date, time, altitude, speed, and course from consumer GPS devices.

However, TinyGPSPlusâ€™s programmer interface is considerably simpler to use than TinyGPS, and the new library can extract arbitrary data from any of the myriad NMEA sentences out there, even proprietary ones.

See [Arduiniana - TinyGPSPlus](http://arduiniana.org/libraries/tinygpsplus/) for more detailed information on how to use TinyGPSPlus.
